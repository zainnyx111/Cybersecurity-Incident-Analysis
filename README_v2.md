# Cybersecurity Incident Analysis

## Purpose
This repository contains detailed analyses of real-life cybersecurity incidents from a defender’s perspective. Each incident is analyzed to demonstrate critical thinking, structured reasoning, and actionable recommendations for both threat elimination and prevention.

## Approach
For each incident, the following workflow was applied:

1. **Incident Overview** – What happened, who was affected, and when.
2. **Compromised Assets** – Data or systems affected and scope of damage.
3. **Attack Vector** – How attackers gained access and exploited weaknesses.
4. **Threat Elimination Strategy** – Steps to contain, remediate, and secure systems after detection.
5. **Threat Prevention Strategy** – Long-term measures to prevent recurrence, including policies, monitoring, architecture improvements, and awareness programs.

## What Recruiters Should Learn
- Ability to analyze incidents from a defender’s perspective
- Understanding of attack flow and compromised assets
- Knowledge of realistic and effective incident response strategies
